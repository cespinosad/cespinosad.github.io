abstract: "This paper explores the welfare cost of trade impediments during the trade war period, highlighting the crucial role of accurately measuring trade elasticitiesâ€”the import demand elasticity and the inverse export supply elasticity. I propose a novel instrument: retaliatory tariffs imposed on sectors different from those targeted by the trade partner. Under WTO rules, countries must match the tariff rate imposed by the trade partner but can choose which products to target. By focusing on price-elastic goods, countries maximize punishment by driving away demand from foreign competitors. Using Canadian retaliation against the U.S., I estimate an inverse export supply elasticity of zero and an import demand elasticity of 5.2, significantly higher than the commonly reported value of around 2.5. This suggests that trade policies tend to target extremes of the elasticity distribution: revenue-raising tariffs on inelastic goods and retaliatory tariffs on elastic goods. By constructing an interval for the average demand elasticity between 2.5 and 5.2, I estimate the U.S. welfare costs to range between \$11 and \$22 billion, doubling prior estimates."

### Abstract:

This paper analyzes the short-run effects of tariffs on Canadian trade volumes and prices. I use shifts in government trade policies, from protective to retaliatory tariffs, to identify trade elasticities. This serves for the construction of a novel instrument to estimate these elasticities at the variety level. I use 2018 Canadian retaliatory tariffs on industries distinct from those protected by the US, as an identification strategy in the IV context. The estimation for the elasticity of demand for imports is -5.2, which is twice as large as those typically reported in the literature. Given there is selection in the tariff policy design, this is a local treatment effect towards the upper tail of the elasticity distribution. On the other hand, retaliatory tariffs on industries protected by the US, are employed to obtain an estimate for the lower end of the distribution. Together, these set bounds on the average elasticity, which lies between -1.9 and -5.2.
