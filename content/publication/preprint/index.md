abstract: This article proposes a methodology to estimate stress testing for the non-financial corporate sector in Chile. The approach is based on a detailed characterization of firms' financial debt, using statistical appendices compiled by the Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (SVS), validated with administrative records from the Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF) and the Central Bank of Chile (BCCh).
